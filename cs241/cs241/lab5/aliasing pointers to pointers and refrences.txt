	pointers 
	refrences
	store the address of variable within the pointers and refs
	type of thing it is pointing to is also in there 
	
	derefrence a pointer
	not derefrence a refrence
	
	int a = 7
	int& b = a
	int*c = &a

	b++ then a++
	int d = 9

	b = d	//the value that b pointed to now becomes 9

	
	c = &d //c points to now
	

	int **f = &c //f points to the pointer that c points to
	int*& g = &c //refrences the pointer c 
	*f = &a	     //now c points to a
	g = &d	     //c points to d
