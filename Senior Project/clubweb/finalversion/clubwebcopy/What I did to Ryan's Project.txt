Ryan, you have C++-style comments in your database file.  Changed // to #.

Changed the database password to mine in conn.php.

Skipped the test users and used my own real users from our roster.

Eliminated the requirement of a 6-char+ password.

In the "Who's coming?" column, names looked like this:  John ,Joe ,Peter.  I changed it to look like this:  John, Joe, Peter.

Changed the admin name to Will.

Changed the day of the week to Mondays. 

It was letting me check out yesterday!  Not good.  Fixed. 

There's something funny going on with the footer -- you can't see its bottom.  I'm on admin's registration page.  Fixed.

Fixed the copyright symbol.

Alphabetized the names in checkouts.

You had a redirect loop:  index.php includes auto.php which includes autoupdate.php which loads index.php via the header command.  Took out the header command.  After that, when I'd log in, it would take me to a blank screen:  login.php loads autoupdate.php with the header command.  Changed it to an include.  Still not working.

I note that you call exit with an error message saying password is wrong.  I want it as an error message.  I'm passing it as a URL argument and having login.php print it.

For Ryan to do:  

//Please -- have a successful (or unsuccessful) registration take me back to the admin's page!  Not with a mouse click, but immediately!

We need to be able to change the date of the meeting, permanently, from the admin page.  Say, meetings are on Monday, but as of 12/1 meetings are on Tuesday.
